<td>When you have been working on a keyboard layout for a while, or
when you are modifying someone else's keyboard layout, you may
wonder if a certain character is already there. To answer this, you
use the Find Key Stroke… command on the Edit menu.<br />
<br />
Choosing the Find Key Stroke… command brings up a dialog asking you
for the string you wish to find. It is not limited to a single
character, but note that it will be an exact match: whatever you
search for, the key must produce exactly that string. The string
can be specified using the same XML notation as used elsewhere in
Ukelele.<br />
<br />
After you click OK, Ukelele will find a matching key stroke or
sequence of key strokes. If there is none, a message in the status
bar will tell you this. Otherwise, the key stroke(s) will be shown
in the status bar, and the last key stroke will be highlighted in
the main keyboard window. As soon as you press any key, the
keyboard window returns to its previous state.
