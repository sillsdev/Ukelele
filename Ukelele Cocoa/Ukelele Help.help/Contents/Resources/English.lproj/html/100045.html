<td>For a keyboard layout stored in a collection, it is possible to
set the “intended language”. This is used for supporting “press and
hold”, a method of typing character variations (typically with
diacritics).<br />
<br />
This technology is only supported for certain languages, and the
list of languages may vary with the release of OS X. There is also
no supported method of extending either the list of languages or
the character variations that can be produced via press and
hold.<br />
<br />
To set the intended language for a keyboard layout, you select the
keyboard layout in the list, then choose Keyboard &gt; Set Keyboard
Language… or click the Language… button, and then choose the
language from the dialog. Only the language is required. For the
script, the only times it is currently useful are for Serbian,
choosing Latin or Cyrillic script, and Chinese, choosing
Traditional or Simplified script. A few regions are supported for
various languages, while the only variants that are currently
supported are some Chinese variants (Wubihua for Simplified, and
Cangjiu, Pinhin, Wubihua and Zhuyin for Traditional).
