<td>Simply defined, a dead key produces no output by itself, but
affects the output produced by the next key that is typed. The name
“dead key” comes from the fact that nothing is produced when you
type it, so it may appear not to do anything.<br />
<br />
A dead key consists of three things:<br />
<ul>
<li>The key you type, also known as the <b>dead key</b></li>
<li>The collection of outputs that the dead key can produce, known
as the <b>dead key state</b></li>
<li>The output the dead key produces when nothing is defined for
the following key, known as the <b>terminator</b>.</li>
</ul>
<br />
As an example, on the US keyboard layout, option-u (⌥u) is a dead
key. The dead key state defines output for the vowels with a
diaresis (umlaut), so that the o key produces ö. The terminator is
the diaresis on its own, so that typing (⌥uk) gives you ¨k.<br />
<br />
The terminator is optional, so that no output is generated when
nothing is defined for the next key in the dead key state.
