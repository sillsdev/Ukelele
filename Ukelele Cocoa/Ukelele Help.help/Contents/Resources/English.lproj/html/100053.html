<td>For keyboard layouts within a keyboard layout collection, you
can localise the keyboard layout name. This enables users to see
the name of the keyboard layout in their own language.<br />
<br />
This is done from the collection window, which has two tabs. You
need to select the Localisations tab, which will show a list of all
the locales available in the collection. A locale is a combination
of a language and a region, optionally (and rarely) with a script.
Examples would be English (UK), French (Canada), or Portuguese
(Portugal). You can add and remove locales from the list using the
buttons below it.<br />
<br />
Once you have locales specified, go back to the Keyboard Layouts
tab. Choose a keyboard layout and select Localise Keyboard Name
from the Keyboard menu or the contextual menu. This brings up a
dialog listing the keyboard name in all of the locales. For those
you have not specified, the default name is used, which is the name
originally given to the keyboard layout. For each locale, you can
select and edit the keyboard layoutâ€™s name in this dialog.
