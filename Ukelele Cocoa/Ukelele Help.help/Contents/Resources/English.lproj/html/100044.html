<td>Keyboard layouts do not have to have an icon file, in which
case they receive a generic keyboard icon. However, you can attach
an icon file to a keyboard layout, and users will see this icon in
the Input menu and in the International preference pane.<br />
<br />
An icon file has to be an Apple icon file in the “icns” format.
There are several utilities around on the Internet which can create
such files from other graphic formats.<br />
<br />
In Ukelele 3, you can attach icons to keyboard layouts in a
collection. You can select the keyboard layout in the list, then
either choose “Attach Icon…” from the Keyboard menu or click the
Icon… button below the list. Either will bring up a dialog asking
you to locate the icon file you wish to attach. You can also drag
an icon file from the Finder onto the keyboard layout in the list.
