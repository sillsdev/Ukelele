<td>Creating a dead key involves choosing the “Create Dead Key…”
command from the Keyboard menu, or clicking the Create button on
the toolbar. What happens next depends whether you have a selected
key or not.<br />
<br />
If you have a selected key, then that key, along with the modifiers
that are active when you choose the menu item or click the toolbar
button, define the dead key.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a selected key, then a different dialog comes up
which requires you to specify the key, either by key code or by
typing or clicking it after the dialog is dismissed.<br />
<br />
The dialog with a selected key and the dialog without a selected
key show the remainder in common. You need to select or create a
dead key state, and can provide a terminator if you are creating a
new dead key state.<br />
<br />
Once you create the dead key, Ukelele automatically enters the new
dead key state so that you can begin to enter the output for that
dead key state. Initially, all the keys are blank, indicating that
there is no output in the dead key state. If the Inspector window
is open, you will see that the new dead key state is listed in the
state stack.
