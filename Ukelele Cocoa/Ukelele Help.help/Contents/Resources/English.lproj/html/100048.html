<td>To enable and use a keyboard layout is a two-step process. The
first step is accomplished in the System Preferences program. Which
preference pane you use depends on which version of OS X you are
using:<br />
<br />
<table><!--HEADING ROW-->
<tr>
<th>OS X Version</th>
<th>Preference Pane</th>
</tr><!--ROW 1 -->
<tr>
<td>10.8 Mountain Lion</td>
<td>Language &amp; Text</td>
</tr><!--ROW 2 -->
<tr>
<td>10.9 Mavericks</td>
<td>Keyboard</td>
</tr><!--ROW 3 -->
<tr>
<td>10.10 Yosemite</td>
<td>Keyboard</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br />
<br />
You need to click on the Input Sources tab in the preference
pane.<br />
<br />
For OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, in the list that is in the pane, you
should be able to find the keyboard layout that you have installed.
The name that the keyboard layout is given in Ukelele is the
relevant one, not the file name. You can sort the table by various
columns, so where it appears is dependent on which column is the
sort column.<br />
<br />
Once you have found your keyboard layout, you need to ensure that
the check box in the first column is checked, which will not be the
case when the keyboard layout is first installed. Also ensure that
“Show input menu in menu bar” at the bottom of the window is
checked.<br />
<br />
For OS X 10.9 Mavericks and 10.10 Yosemite, click the + button at
the bottom of the list on the left. This brings up another dialog
sheet which lists languages on the left and keyboard layouts on the
right. You will probably need to select “Others” on the left to see
all the keyboard layouts. Again, you are looking for the name given
in Ukelele, not the file name.<br />
<br />
Once you have found your keyboard layout, click Add, and it will be
activated. Again, make sure that “Show Input menu in menu bar”
below the keyboard layouts pane is checked.<br />
<br />
The second step is to enable the keyboard from the Input menu. This
menu is on the right of the menu bar, and usually has a flag there,
corresponding to the current input source (keyboard layout or input
method). If the Input menu is not shown, it has to be enabled in
International Preferences. You then can activate your keyboard
layout by selecting it from the menu.
