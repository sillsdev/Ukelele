<td>If you want to install the keyboard layout on your own
computer, the simplest way to do it is from within Ukelele. There
is a submenu of the File menu, Install, which offers two options,
Install For Current User and Install For All Users. The latter will
require authentication. The first time you do this, you will need
to authenticate twice, once to install a helper application, and
once to actually install the keyboard layout.<br />
<br />
If you want to install the keyboard layout on a different computer,
you need to do so manually. Ukelele will let you create an
installer disk image that allows you to install the keyboard layout
by drag and drop on any computer.<br />
<br />
There are several places on a computer where you can install a
keyboard layout. The main difference between them is who is able to
see and use the keyboard layout.<br />
<br />
If you want the keyboard layout to be visible only to yourself and
no other users on your computer, install it in the folder<br />
<br />
~/Library/Keyboard Layouts<br />
<br />
where ~ means your home folder. In other words, this is a folder
called “Keyboard Layouts” (which you can create if it doesn’t
already exist) in the Library folder inside your home folder. To
get to the Library folder, which is hidden by default in OS X 10.9
(Mavericks) and later, select the Go menu in the Finder and press
the option key, which will then show Library.<br />
<br />
If you want the keyboard layout to be used by any user of your
computer, the folder to install is:<br />
<br />
/Library/Keyboard Layouts<br />
<br />
That is a folder called “Keyboard Layouts” in the Library folder at
the top level of your startup disk. Again, you can create it if it
doesn’t already exist.<br />
<br />
Finally, if your computer is used as a server for other Macs, you
can put the keyboard layout in the folder:<br />
<br />
/Network/Library/Keyboard Layouts<br />
<br />
That is a folder called “Keyboard Layouts” inside a folder called
“Library" inside the Network folder at the top level of your
startup disk. Again, you can create these folders as needed.<br />
<br />
Finally, a word of caution. <span class="Style3">Never</span> edit
an installed keyboard layout. <span class="Style3">Always</span>
edit a copy, then install the edited copy. Editing an installed
keyboard layout can cause your system to crash.
