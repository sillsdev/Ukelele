<td>The modifier combinations of a keyboard layout are edited on
the Modifiers tab of the keyboard layout window.<br />
<br />
The modifiers tab shows a table listing all the modifier
combinations. The first column is the set number. There can be more
than one row with the same set number. All rows with the same set
number are equivalent, and work to produce the same sets of
output.<br />
<br />
Across each row are the different modifiers. If the keyboard layout
has some modifier combinations with both left and right modifier
keys, these are shown, and the <span class="Style1">Simplify</span>
button will be enabled.<br />
<br />
For each modifier, you will see one of three states:<br />
<ul>
<li>The modifier’s symbol in blue, which indicates that the
modifier must be pressed.</li>
<li>The modifier’s symbol in red with strikethrough, which
indicates that the modifier must not be pressed.</li>
<li>A blank, which indicates that the modifier’s state is not
relevant.</li>
</ul>
<br />
To edit a modifier combination, double-click the row, and a dialog
will open allowing you to make changes.<br />
<br />
You can add a new set of modifiers by clicking the + button, and
delete an existing set by clicking the - button. There are
variations depending on whether you choose to add a new set, add
another combination to an existing set, remove a combination from
an existing set or delete a whole set. For details of all these,
see the manual.<br />
<br />
There is also a pop-up menu for the default index. This is the
index that is selected if no listed modifier state matches the
current modifiers.<br />
<br />
To help you build your modifier sets, you can use the <span class=
"Style1">State</span> tab of the information inspector. When you
press some modifiers, you will see what modifiers are pressed and
the index number of the set that is matched.
