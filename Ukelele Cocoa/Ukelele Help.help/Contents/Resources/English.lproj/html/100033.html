<td>With five separate modifiers, there are up to 32 possible
modifier key combinations, which should be more than sufficient for
most uses. The question is how to decide on which modifier
combinations are needed. The answer to that is dependent on many
things, but here are some guidelines:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>If you are dealing with a Roman alphabet or other script with
upper and lower case, then you should probably make shift produce
upper case, and no shift produce lower case.</li>
<li>Very often, shift and caps lock will be the same for letter
keys. They do not need to be the same for non-letter keys (numbers
and punctuation).</li>
<li>It is often a good idea to have the command-key combinations
either the same as without a command key, or the same as what is
printed on the keys. This helps in making the keyboard shortcuts
work as expected.</li>
<li>One approach in having two scripts (e.g. Devanagari and Roman)
available is to use caps lock to switch between the two
scripts.</li>
<li>The most commonly used characters should require fewer modifier
keys.</li>
<li>The control key is not always useful, as its interpretation can
be over-ridden by the operating system. For example, control-i may
well be seen as a tab, and some control-key combinations may simply
do nothing. Using control-option is a better solution.</li>
