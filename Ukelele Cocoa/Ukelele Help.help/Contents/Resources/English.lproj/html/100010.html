<td>You can also create a keyboard layout collection containing a
single keyboard layout which is created from the current keyboard
input source. This takes the currently selected keyboard input
source, not an input method for a complex script such as Chinese,
Japanese or Korean, and converts it to a form that Ukelele can
edit. If there is an icon associated with the current keyboard
input source, Ukelele attempts to copy it. Also, if the current
keyboard input source has a language specified, Ukelele will copy
that as well.<br />
<br />
Once the new keyboard layout is created, you will see another
keyboard layout collection window with that keyboard layout in it.
