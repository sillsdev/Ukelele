<td>What you see on the screen is only a representation of your
keyboard layout with a given keyboard type. Keyboard layouts work
with any keyboard type, so don’t panic if it isn’t what you
expect!<br />
<br />
When you open a keyboard window, Ukelele does its best to work out
what actual (hardware) keyboard you are using. It isn't always
successful, especially if you have a newer model of Mac, or are
using a non-Apple keyboard.<br />
<br />
Go to the Keyboard menu and choose Keyboard Type... This brings up
a dialog to choose what kind of keyboard to display on screen. You
can choose any of those in the list on the left, and a description
will appear below.<br />
<br />
The important thing is the coding popup button on the right. If
your keyboard looks like this:<br />
<img id="1" src="../images/english_keyboard.png" width="428"
height="182" title="US keyboard" alt="" /><br />
then it is an ANSI keyboard, the kind you get in USA, Australia,
UK, etc. If it looks like this:<br />
<img id="2" src="../images/en_international_keyboard.png" width=
"428" height="182" title="European keyboard" alt="" /><br />
then it is an ISO keyboard, the kind you get in Europe and
elsewhere (apart from Japan). Note the extra key in the lower left,
between shift and Z.
