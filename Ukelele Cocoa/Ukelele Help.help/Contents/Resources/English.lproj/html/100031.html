<td>The structure of the keyboard layout file allows you to link
several keys together so that they behave the same way. For
example, it is often good to have the same behaviour for a letter
key plus shift as for the same key plus caps lock, so that they
always produce the same output, no matter what dead key state is
active.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, however, this linking is not what you want. If you get
unexpected results from modifying one key, in that it causes a
change in that key with a different combination of modifiers, then
you can unlink that key and modifier combination. Just select the
key, press the required modifiers, and choose “Unlink Key...” from
the Keyboard menu or click the Unlink button in the toolbar. You
can also unlink a key without a selected key, in which case you
will be asked to select the key, either by code or by typing or
clicking.<br />
<br />
You can also unlink an entire modifier set. If shift and caps lock
had most keys linked, and you would prefer to have them unlinked,
then you can unlink the whole set.
