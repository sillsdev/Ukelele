<td>A dead key is a key combination that triggers a dead key state.
It can be any key you like, with any combination of modifiers you
like.<br />
<br />
An early convention with the Mac was to make dead keys ordinary
keys with the option key, such as option-u for diaresis, option-e
for acute accent, option-n for tilde, or option-` for grave accent.
However, this is just a convention, and you are free to use
whatever you like.<br />
<br />
Be aware that using the control key by itself as a modifier is
problematic. If you want a dead key to use the control key, it is
usually safer to use both control and option together.
