<td>Dead keys are a powerful part of any keyboard layout, but with
power comes complexity.<br />
<br />
The idea of a dead key is quite simple. It is a key that produces
no output on its own, but it affects the output of the next key
that is typed. The classic example of the use of a dead key is to
add an accent mark, such as an acute or umlaut, to another letter.
So, on the US keyboard layout, typing option-u followed by o gives
ö.<br />
<br />
Creating dead keys is fairly straightforward in Ukelele. However,
the real work comes before you get to Ukelele, in designing how
your keyboard layout should work. For more on this, see the
manual.<br />
<br />
The different parts of a dead key are the dead key itself, the dead
key state, and the terminator. You don’t have to know the dead key
state name, or define a terminator, but all of these are accessible
with Ukelele.<br />
