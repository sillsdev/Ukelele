<td><span class="Style1">New Interface</span><br />
Ukelele 3.0 represents another total rewrite of Ukelele. The core
code that models the keyboard layout is unchanged, but the whole
user interface has been completely replaced with new code that
follows current OS X conventions, is written as a Cocoa
application, and should be more robust for the coming years.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">New Document Model</span><br />
Ukelele 3.0 adopts the new document model introduced by Apple. In
this model, changes made to a document are automatically saved. The
thing to note is that, if you want to make a new document from an
existing one, you should choose Duplicate from the File menu, which
will create a new copy that you can save as you wish.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Keyboard Layout Collections</span><br />
The preferred document format has changed from a simple keyboard
layout file (with .keylayout extension) to a keyboard layout
collection. These are packaged as bundles, so that they appear as a
single document in the Finder. A keyboard layout collection
contains one or more keyboard layouts, along with optional icons
and intended languages for each of them.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Keyboard Layout Window Changes</span><br />
The main keyboard layout window now uses a tabbed interface to show
the keyboard, modifiers and comments views, rather than the
modifiers drawer and the toolbar button for showing comments in
Ukelele 2.x.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Simplified Interactions</span><br />
Many things have been reworked in the user interface, with the idea
that common actions can be done more simply. The idea of a selected
key has been introduced, allowing you to select a key any way you
want, then perform an action on that key. For some actions,
multiple dialogs have been combined to make it easier to do all
that is necessary.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Quick Look Capability</span><br />
Ukelele now provides a Quick Look preview of a keyboard
layout.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Simplified Modifiers</span><br />
Since there is little point in having keyboard layouts refer to
left and right modifier keys (because they are no longer supported
by Apple keyboards), Ukelele can now simplify the modifier sets of
a keyboard layout, which should make it easier to understand the
modifier combinations. Also, the inspector now has the capability
to show what modifiers are currently pressed, and which modifier
set they match. Further, the modifiers view uses symbols rather
than words to show the modifiers, which is hopefully clearer.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Editing Key Output</span><br />
The standard way to edit key output is now done with a popover,
though the option of a sheet is there for those who prefer
it.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Standard Keyboard Layouts</span><br />
When creating a new keyboard layout, the options for standard
keyboard layouts have been expanded to add the Colemak keyboard
layout, a recent ergonomic layout. It is also possible to create a
keyboard layout that includes two or three different keyboard
layouts, with the command and/or caps lock keys switching between
them.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Updated display of key output</span><br />
As of Ukelele 3.1, the display of key output has been changed to
use a more standard model, hopefully giving a more accurate
reflection of the way that key output will be displayed by other
applications.<br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Localisation of keyboard layout
names</span><br />
As of Ukelele 3.2, keyboard layout names within a collection may be
localised. This is a two-step process, first adding one or more
locales, then providing localised names for keyboard layouts in
those locales.
