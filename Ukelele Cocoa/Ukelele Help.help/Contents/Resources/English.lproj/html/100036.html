<td>Every keyboard layout has a name associated with it. This is
not necessarily related to the file name, but often is. The name is
what appears in the Input menu and the International preference
pane.<br />
<br />
You can set the keyboard layout’s name by choosing “Set Keyboard
Name and ID...” from the Keyboard menu. Any string is valid as a
name, but choose one that will be clear in the input menu and in
System Preferences when you want to enable it.<br />
<br />
Apart from the name, every keyboard layout has a numeric ID. The ID
has to be in certain ranges, depending on the script associated
with the keyboard layout. For most cases, the script is Unicode,
and that means that the ID must be negative. Ideally, the ID should
be unique amongst all the keyboard layouts on your computer, so
Ukelele will choose a random ID in the appropriate range when you
set the script. You can also change the ID by clicking the
<span class="Style1">Generate</span> button or entering a number
yourself.
