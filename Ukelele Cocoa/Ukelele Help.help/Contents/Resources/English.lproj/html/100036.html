<td>Every keyboard layout has a name associated with it. This is
not necessarily related to the file name, but often is. The name is
what appears in the Input menu and the International preference
pane.<br />
<br />
You can set the keyboard layout’s name by choosing “Set Keyboard
Name and Script...” from the Keyboard menu. Any string is valid as
a name, but choose one that will be clear in the input menu and in
System Preferences when you want to enable it.<br />
<br />
Apart from the name, every keyboard layout has an associated
script, which is Unicode or one of a limited number of scripts
supported by Apple. Unless you have a compelling reason, Unicode is
the best choice, as choosing another script opens you to the
possibility of generating output outside that script, which may
confuse applications.<br />
<br />
There is also a numeric ID for every keyboard layout. Ukelele
assigns valid, random IDs for keyboard layouts, so you should not
need to bother about them. They are visible in the Inspector if you
really want to know them.
