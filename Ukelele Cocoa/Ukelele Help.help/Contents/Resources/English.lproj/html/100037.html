<td>Any XML file can contain comments, including the keyboard
layout files that Ukelele can edit. Ukelele automatically provides
one comment which is updated with a time stamp whenever you save
the keyboard layout (this can be turned off in Preferences). If you
create a keyboard layout with Ukelele, another comment is inserted
to give a time stamp for when it was created.<br />
<br />
You may want to add comments for various reasons, such as inserting
a copyright notice, acknowledging sources, or documenting changes.
There is no restriction on the number of comments or on their
content.<br />
<br />
To see and edit the comments in the keyboard layout, choose the
Comments tab in the keyboard layout window.<br />
<br />
Comments can be freely edited, added or deleted, apart from the
automatic time stamp comments.<br />
<br />
If you want to attach a comment to a particular key, say to
document how it is different to another keyboard layout, you can
choose “Add Comment...” from the Keyboard menu, and then choose the
key to which you want to attach the comment. This will show the
comment pane with a blank comment.
