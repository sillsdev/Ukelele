<td>Every key on a keyboard has a key code. Normally these are in
the range 0 to 127, but can go as high as 511. Obviously, no
keyboard has all possible keys on it, so Ukelele allows you to
enter a key code so that you can modify a key which isn’t actually
on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
The keyboard layout window can only show representations of Apple’s
keyboards. If your hardware keyboard is not made by Apple, there
could be keys that are not represented in the keyboard layout
window, even if you try to find a matching keyboard type. You can
change output for these keys by selecting the key by key
code.<br />
<br />
But how do you find out the key code? The answer is to use the
information inspector, on the <span class="Style1">State</span>
tab. When you press a key, its key code is shown. Note that some
things will prevent the key code appearing. If you have hardware
control keys, such as brightness, volume, etc, then they will take
effect before they are seen by Ukelele, so the key code never
reaches Ukelele to show it. Also, if you have assigned a global hot
key, such as showing the dashboard, that happens, and again Ukelele
does not see the key press.
