<td>If you have been creating a number of dead key states, you may
come to the point where you realise that one or more is no longer
necessary, and there is no way to actually get to that state,
because the dead key either has been deleted or changed to a
different dead key state.<br />
<br />
In this case, the dead key states are still available in the
keyboard layout, but are not of use to the user of the keyboard
layout. In fact, they merely add some extra size to the file, and
possibly incur a slight performance penalty when the keyboard
layout is loaded by the operating system. To remove these dead key
states, choose “Remove Unused States” from the Keyboard menu.
