<td>Ukelele understands Unicode natively. You can put any Unicode
code point as output, apart from those code points designated as
“reserved” or “not a character”. All of the dialogs and key caps
should be able to display any character, though there will be many
characters for which there is no font available on any given
system.<br />
<br />
The Unicode standard defines unique numbers that designate
characters. You will often see them written like U+10F3 (which is
Georgian letter we). The number is hexadecimal (base 16), and is
written with the digits 0–9 and letters A–F or a–f.<br />
<br />
If you want to enter a character by its code point, there are two
ways that this can be done within Ukelele, either using the
hexadecimal number or the decimal (base 10) equivalent. These are
expressed like this:<br />
<ul>
<li>&amp;​#x<i>nnnn</i>; (hexadecimal)</li>
<li>&amp;​#<i>nnnn</i>; (decimal)</li>
</ul>
In each case, the <span class="Style3">n</span> represents a digit.
Leading zeros can be omitted, and you can use upper or lower case
letters a–f in a hexadecimal number. The “x” to designate it as
hexadecimal must be lower case, though. Notice the semicolon at the
end of the number, as it is required.
