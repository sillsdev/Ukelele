<td>Sometimes, such as when creating a family of keyboard layouts,
a dead key in an existing keyboard layout does what you want. As a
shortcut, you can import the dead key from the other keyboard
layout.<br />
<br />
There is one condition, that the modifier combinations between the
two keyboard layouts must be equivalent. This is so that you get
the expected outputs with the various modifier combinations.<br />
<br />
To import the dead key, first select “Import Dead Key...” from the
Keyboard menu. In the choose file dialog, choose the keyboard
layout which has the dead key you wish to import. Next, select the
dead key state from that keyboard layout. The next dialog asks you
to give a name for the dead key state in the destination keyboard
layout. You will then have to create a dead key which triggers the
new dead key state.
