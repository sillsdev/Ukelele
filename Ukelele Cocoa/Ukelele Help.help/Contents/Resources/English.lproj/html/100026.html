<td>A dead key state is an internal state within the operating
system, part of the way that keyboard input is processed. When the
user types a dead key, the system enters the corresponding dead key
state, which is how the system decides what output to produce for
the next key.<br />
<br />
Another way of thinking of it is that the system takes note of the
dead key, and it will look up the next key in a special table. If
there is an entry for the next key in that table, the corresponding
output is produced.<br />
<br />
Dead key states have names. You donâ€™t have to know the name, or
assign one yourself. However, it is useful in some cases to know
the name of the dead key state. If you want two different dead keys
to enter the same dead key state, you need to know the name so that
you can enter it at the appropriate time. Again, if you have
multi-level dead keys, you need to know the names of the states
involved.<br />
