<td>Alas, not everything works as you might hope! Sometimes there
are problems in using a keyboard layout, and it is often hard to
know what is happening.<br />
<br />
The first question to ask is whether the program you are using
supports Unicode. The vast majority of programs do support it. Some
older programs do not, and some have limited support. Often the
developer can tell you whether a program will work with Unicode.
The usual symptoms are either that the keyboard layout simply
doesn’t work, or the characters produced are not what you expect,
or that some characters don’t appear while others do.<br />
<br />
Mac OS X has had an annoying tendency, though it has been
improving, of suddenly switching input sources without the user
making the change. This might be when you switch applications, or
even move between fields on a web form. The nastiest trick is when
you tab into a password field in Safari, which may switch keyboard
layouts to some standard such as US.<br />
<br />
Apple seems to privilege the system’s keyboard layouts. You must
have at least one active, so you cannot just have your own keyboard
layouts active. If the input source switches by itself, it will
often be to one of the system’s keyboard layouts. Just keep an eye
on the input menu if something appears to be going wrong. Also, the
login window usually uses only Apple’s keyboard layouts.<br />
<br />
If you cannot find your keyboard layout in the International
preference pane, there is a small possibility that there is an
error in the XML format. The way to verify this is to look in the
Console application to see if there is some message that mentions
the string uchr, probably complaining about some error. If this is
the case, please contact the developer at the email address in the
Read Me file.<br />
<br />
Another issue that people see is when they try to change some keys
in unusual ways. In particular, there what are referred to as the
“special” keys, that is, ones that do no produce a regular
character, such as the arrow keys, delete, help, and so on. Trying
to change the output of these keys, or making another key behave
like one of them, is not always supported. Some of Apple’s own
applications do not support this. You are best off not trying this,
or being sure that the application you use will work correctly.
