<td>You can drag and drop a character, or even a string of up to 20
Unicode characters, onto a key in the keyboad layout window to
change its output. The modifiers that are active at the time you
drop the character (or string of characters) onto the key are those
that come into play.<br />
<br />
Where do you get characters? Virtually any application that handles
text will let you drag text out of its window and into Ukeleleâ€™s
keyboard layout window. Otherwise, the <span class=
"Style1">Character Viewer</span> can be a good source. You can
access this from the input menu (the one with a flag), or from the
Emoji &amp; Symbols command in the Edit menu.
