<td>Dead key state names are arbitrary strings. You can assign any
name you choose, or let Ukelele assign names for you. However, it
can be useful to have names that are meaningful to you as you build
the keyboard layout. For example, it is easier to remember that a
dead key state called “acute” adds an acute accent than it would be
if the name were “State 3”.<br />
<br />
You can change the name of a dead key state at any time by choosing
“Change State Name...” from the Keyboard menu. The only limitation
is that you cannot make it a name that is already in use, or the
special state name “none”, which is used to indicate that there is
no dead key active.
