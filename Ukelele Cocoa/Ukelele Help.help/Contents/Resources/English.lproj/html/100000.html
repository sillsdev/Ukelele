Ukelele is a <span class="Style3">Unicode Keyboard Layout
Editor</span>, an application that allows you to create and modify
keyboad layouts which can be used with Mac OS X 10.2 or
later.<br />
<br />
Apart from Apple’s own keyboard layout format, macOS supports an
XML-based format for keyboard layouts since Mac OS X 10.2. Such XML
files can be generated and edited by Ukelele and installed using
its built-in Install commands, as a stand-alone file (.keylayout)
or in a bundle, for the current user only or for all users.
(<span class="Style4">In OS 10.13, High Sierra, please install For
Current User</span>.) Alternatively, (bundles containing) keyboard
layouts can be manually copied to the <span class="Style1">Keyboard
Layouts</span> folder either in the global Library folder or a
user’s Library folder. Ukelele can also export an Installer Disk
Image (.dmg) which makes it easy to share custom keyboard layouts
with other users.<br />
<br />
After installing a keyboard layout and logging out and back in (to
make macOS refresh the list of available keyboard layouts) the user
can activate the new keyboard layout(s) in a <span class=
"Style1">System Preferences</span> pane. Its exact name and
location vary from version to version of OS X/macOS. In OS X 10.10
(Yosemite), it is the Input Sources tab of the <span class=
"Style1">Keyboard</span> preferences pane.<br />
<br />
However, modifying keyboard layouts—let alone creating completely
new keyboard layouts, such as for a new script—by directly editing
the XML files is tedious and error-prone. Ukelele aims to simplify
keyboard layout editing by providing a graphical interface, so that
users can create a keyboard layout by editing key output visually,
without worrying about the underlying XML syntax.<br />
<br />
Ukelele can create most kinds of keyboard layout, the exceptions
being the Unicode Hex Input keyboard layout and those associated
with an Input Method, which are usually for complex scripts such as
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tamil or Vietnamese.<br />
<br />
Ukelele is able to create “dead keys”, which are often used for
adding diacritical marks (accents, tone marks, etc) to other
characters, which can expand the character repertoire of a keyboard
layout considerably.
