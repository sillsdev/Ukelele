<td>The keys that are not ordinary output keys are referred to as
special keys. These include return, enter, the arrow keys, tab,
delete, backspace, page up, page down, home, end, escape, the
function keys F1-F20, help, clear, and a few others. These do not
produce normal output, but exercise control functions, and have
specific required outputs.<br />
<br />
Many keyboard layouts, including those generated through some of
the automatic conversion tools, are missing the output for some of
these special keys. In part, this is because Apple has introduced
more function keys on their keyboards, and older keyboard layouts
do not have the output for the extra function keys.<br />
<br />
When you open a keyboard layout that is missing some special key
output, Ukelele asks if you want to add it. If you do not do so at
this point, you can always add it by choosing “Add Special Key
Output” from the Keyboard menu. This will not alter any output that
you have already assigned, but will only add output for those
special keys that do not have any output defined.
