\f0\fs24 \cf0 Thanks to all the users of previous versions of Ukelele, who have given valuable feedback and suggestions over the years. Particular thanks to the Ukelele Users forum members, who have helped both me in developing Ukelele, and others with questions on how to use keyboard layouts on the Mac.\
